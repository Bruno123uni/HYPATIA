            <p style="text-align: left; padding:20px 0;">A crucial contribution. Rosalind Franklin made a crucial contribution to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, but some would say she got a raw deal. Biographer Brenda Maddox called her the "Dark Lady of DNA," based on a once disparaging reference to Franklin by one of her coworkers. Unfortunately, this negative appellation undermined the positive impact of her discovery. Indeed, Franklin is in the shadows of science history, for while her work on DNA was crucial to the discovery of its structure, her contribution to that landmark discovery is little known.

Malaria is caused by a single-cell parasite that causes severe fever. In the 1970s, after studies of traditional herbal medicines, Tu Youyou focused on sweet wormwood and managed to extract a substance, artemisinin, which inhibits the malaria parasite. Drugs based on artemisinin have led to the survival and improved health of millions of people.

            <h5 class = "text-left text-capitalize text-success"><b>Sterotypes</b></h5>
            <p class = "text-left text-muted">Sterotypes start effecting a child's ability to think from the second they are exposed to main-stream media,
            or begin interacting with other people. They are led to believe that they are true representation of individuals and when the sterotypes match their
            surroundings they become embedded in their thinking style. Boys are often encouraged to pursue STEM subjects in school due to the belief that they perform
            better at these subjects and are thus precieved to be "masculine" subjects. Girls on the other hand are often encouraged to take on arts, art, language and
            humanities; even though girls perform equally well as boys in STEM subjects. Another important factor is the portrayl of scientists in media.
            The young child who believes that only women are nurses and only men are doctors may have developed this understanding because the first doctor
            he or she saw was a man, who was assisted by a female nurse.  <p><br>

            <p class = "text-left text-muted">Women make less than men in some science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.
            WThe gender pay gap begins when women and men with earned degrees enter the workforce.
            Further, the gender pay gap may arise due to cultural beliefs about the appropriateness of women and men for STEM
            professions that shape individuals’ self-beliefs in the form of self-efficacy.
            Another reason for this is the difference in confidence displayed by males and females, male workers are more likely to be confident
            in their skill-set whereas women often doubt their capabilities. <p>

            <h5 class = "text-left text-capitalize text-success"><b>Lack of relatable role-models</b></h5>
            <p class = "text-left text-muted">Historically, the work of pioneering women in science, technology,
            engineering, mathematics (STEM) related fields has been too often overlooked.
            In the present day, it’s also clear that the under-representation of women in STEM means that there are fewer role models for young girls.With no one to
            look up to, and be guided by; young girls may find it difficult to see themselves as a scientist, and may feel out of place. <p>

            <p class = "text-left text-muted">Recently many government acts and normal people have taken up initiatives towards which they have put in their heart and soul to devote to women who need help in fields of stem, psychological or emotional trauma, they help the people by becoming suitable role models and setting good examples so that the women can then do the same for when they are required for help. These mentors can really change the way one thinks, help them to deal with issues that they once considered private and make them speak and raise their voices so that they are heard. They help them lighten the weight on their shoulders become optimistic etc.

Despite multi-faceted advancements across the globe, the STEM industry still lacks women in intellectually challenging positions, let alone in senior leadership. Ways to reduce bias are:
- Anonymizing CVs in the recruitment process
- Inviting more women researchers as suggestions to journals for peer review
- Encouraging double-blinded peer-review process
- Choosing journals that follow publishing ethics
- Decrease gender pay gap based on success rate
- Focus on equity, and not equality
- Collaborating with renowned women researchers in your field
- Not shying away from male dominance in the workplace
- Encouraging more women to pursue careers in the STEM industry
- Promoting women to leadership roles

They always pressure the brain to think more and more so that it can introduce various perspectives over time.
